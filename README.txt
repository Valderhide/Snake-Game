# A Basic Snake Game

An introductory project made to learn coding.

## Description

This game was made as part of a larger coding course offered by the fine folks at Get Coding. Through this project I learned a little bit about HTML and CSS, but due to the nature of the game a lot of work was done with Javascript, such as creating divs to form a grid pattern, using JS to edit the color of divs to form the snake and determining how to move the snake while maintaining a certain lenght.
